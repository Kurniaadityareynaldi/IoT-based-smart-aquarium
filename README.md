**Smart Aquarium Prototype for Freshwater Ornamental Fish Using NodeMCU with IoT-Based Control
**

This GitHub repository showcases a final project from the Electrical Engineering Department, Universitas Gunadarma. The project focuses on the development of an IoT-based smart aquarium designed to simplify the maintenance and care of freshwater ornamental fish. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, this smart aquarium automates water temperature control, lighting adjustments, and fish feeding.

Key features of the system include:

Temperature Monitoring and Control: The DS18B20 temperature sensor achieves an average error of 0.37 °C and a relative error of 1.46%, ensuring precise water temperature regulation.

Lighting Management: The WS2812B LED lights adjust brightness and color based on user settings through the Blynk application, with an average delay of 1.61 seconds for turning off and 1.53 seconds for turning on the lights in automatic mode.

Automated Feeding: A servo motor dispenses an average of 5.56 grams of fish feed per operation, with a delay of approximately 1.56 seconds in automatic mode.

Heater Control: A relay-driven heater maintains optimal water temperature by activating and deactivating automatically.

This project demonstrates the integration of IoT, sensors, and actuators to create a functional and user-friendly smart aquarium system. The repository includes all relevant source code, schematics, and documentation to replicate or expand upon the prototype.
